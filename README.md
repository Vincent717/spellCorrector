# spellingCorrector
a spelling corrector written in Prolog

following the idea from http://norvig.com/spell-correct.html

But implemented with Prolog.

**To Run**

1. consult spellCorrector.pl into swi-prolog version 7.0+
+  try to run: corrects('tha',Result).

--------

**Some Note**

The first part of the code is the dictionary, you can implement your own.

The second part is the main code, which is hard annotated.

Have fun :)

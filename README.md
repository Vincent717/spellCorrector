# spellingCorrector
a spelling corrector written in Prolog

following the idea from http://norvig.com/spell-correct.html
.but implemented with Prolog.

**To Run**

just consult spellCorrector.pl into swi-prolog version 7.0+

then try: 

**corrects('tha',Result).**


**Some Note**

The first part of the code is the dictionary, you can implement your own.
The second part is the main code, which is hard annotated.

Have fun. :)
